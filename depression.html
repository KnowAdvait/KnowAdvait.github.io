            <h2 class="head">How Depression Leads to Suicide</h2>

            <p class="font1">Depression is a common mental disorder affecting more than 264 million people worldwide. It is characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. In fact, more than 700000 people die due to suicide every year. For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-19 year-olds.77% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. Ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally.The number of cases of depression in adults increases each year. The total number of adults with the condition rose by 1 million people each year. In most of the adult age groups, rates of depression increased year to year.</p>

            <h2 class="head">Understanding the Root Cause</h2>
            <p class="font1"> So what do you think, what is the main reason behind all this? Is it sadness ? if it is, then what is the reason behind sadness? This is the point where everyone goes blank and the most interesting part is that no one talks about this thing. They will tell you to hug someone, talk to someone, try to sleep properly and all other shit, deep down you also know that this is not immensely helping. Specialists are prescribing various medications to the victim but how can a medicine help to resolve a mental problem? Medicines are useful if there is some physical injury. Mental problems can only be fixed through right understanding of yourself, we need a one and last conclusion for all our problems, a crystal clear mind, but to be at this level of awareness requires a lot of understanding.</p>

            <p class="font1"> When your mind is clear and you know what you have to do then these problems are a piece of cake for you. You should have to utilize your energy in a right work, if you are a student then the main focus of your life is to study and when you do this then you donâ€™t have the time to think about all these problems. </p>
