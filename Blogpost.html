            <p class="font1">Knowing Advaita Vedanta means knowing yourself to the fullest, where no miseries and pain lie, where nothing is good or bad, it’s just Atman (Self) everywhere. But to be at this level of consciousness requires a lot of self-control towards your material desires because if you look carefully at the roots of your problems it all lies in this material world. If we look at the world and question, how this world has been created, by whom it has been created, and why it has been created, then our question is illogical because I’m the one who is seeing this universe and if I’m not there then there is nothing, so we must ask first, who am I.</p>

            <p class="font1"> In Hinduism, there are various books to read, some book deals with life after death, and people often get bewildered about what to believe. In this case, one must look for the highest possibility of thought, and it is Vedanta. Sanatana Dharma is estimated to be around 5000 years old, so the core of dharma has gotten out of sight and all the unnecessary things have been highlighted as religion, this is causing the loss of dharma, people didn’t know the true meaning of their religion and doing all other shit in the name of dharma.</p>

            <p class="font1"> We need righteous knowledge to perform righteous action, and this is the reason one should look towards Vedanta, to know the true meaning of life and to live free from all the slavery. Vedanta gives us a different perspective and tells you that there is something unique above all the materialistic things you can see. </p>

            <p class="font1">The core books of Hinduism consist of Vedas and Upanishads, there are four Vedas; the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. There are over 200 Upanishads but the traditional number is 108. Of them, only 10 are the principal Upanishads: Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashan, manduka, mandukya, tattiriya, Aitareya, Chhandogya, and brihadaranyaka. If we talk about the Bhagavad-Gita, it is a Hindu scripture that is part of ancient history, THE MAHABHARATA. Gita is frequently treated as an Upanishad in its own right, one of the several books that represent the words and message of God, and is considered among the most important texts in the Hindu tradition. Apart from these books, we should not give much importance to any other books, especially if the books are not pointing towards the core.</p>

            <p class="font1">In upcoming blog posts, we will go deeper into Vedanta and try to learn the message our ancestors wanted us to know. </p>
